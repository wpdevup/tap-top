Advanced back-to-top button with smart scroll library detection, universal anchor fixes, adaptive positioning, and accessibility features.

== Description ==

**Tap Top** goes far beyond simple back-to-top plugins by solving real problems that modern WordPress sites face with scroll libraries and complex layouts.

= ðŸš€ What Makes Tap Top Unique =

**Library-Aware Scroll Behavior**
* **Automatic Detection**: Detects Lenis, Locomotive Scroll, and SmoothScrollbar automatically
* **Native API Integration**: Uses each library's public API to avoid conflicts and broken behavior
* **Multi-Container Support**: Works with nested scroll containers and page builder layouts
* **Graceful Fallback**: Custom smooth scroll for sites without these libraries

**Universal Anchor Link Fixes**
* **Cross-Library Normalization**: Makes anchor links work consistently across all scroll libraries
* **Smart Offset Detection**: Automatically accounts for sticky headers and fixed elements
* **In-Page TOC Support**: Ensures table of contents and anchor navigation work perfectly
* **Hash URL Handling**: Proper deep-linking support with smooth scrolling

**Adaptive Positioning & Obstruction Avoidance**
* **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects cookie banners, chat widgets, and other fixed elements
* **Dynamic Repositioning**: Moves button to avoid overlapping with other interface elements
* **Mobile Safe Areas**: Full support for iPhone notches, Android punch-holes, and gesture areas
* **ResizeObserver Integration**: Responds to layout changes in real-time

**Accessibility-First Design**
* **Motion Preferences**: Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` setting automatically
* **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic markup
* **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility support
* **High Contrast Mode**: Enhanced visibility in high-contrast and forced-colors modes
* **Focus Management**: Proper focus handling and visual indicators

**Advanced Gutenberg Integration**
* **Full Site Editor Support**: Works perfectly with block themes and site editing
* **Per-Template Overrides**: Different settings for different templates and pages
* **Live Preview**: Real-time preview in the block editor
* **Flexible Display Modes**: Global, Block-Only, or Hybrid approaches

**Performance & Modern Development**
* **Zero Dependencies**: No jQuery or external libraries required
* **Efficient Loading**: Idle-until-visible and intelligent loading strategies
* **GPU Acceleration**: Hardware-accelerated animations where supported
* **Minimal Footprint**: Lightweight code with maximum functionality

= ðŸ“‹ Supported Scroll Libraries =

**Tested and Verified:**
* âœ… **Lenis** (v1.0+) - Automatic detection and native API integration
* âœ… **Locomotive Scroll** (v4.x and v5.x) - Full compatibility with both versions
* âœ… **SmoothScrollbar** (v8.x) - Native API usage for smooth integration
* âœ… **Custom Scroll Containers** - Detects nested and custom implementations
* âœ… **Native Browser Scrolling** - Enhanced smooth scrolling fallback

**How It Works:**
The plugin detects which scroll library is active and uses its native API methods:
* Lenis: `lenis.scrollTo()` with proper easing
* Locomotive: `locomotive.scrollTo()` with momentum preservation
* SmoothScrollbar: `scrollbar.scrollTo()` with native smooth timing

= ðŸŽ¯ Display Modes =

**Global Mode**
* Traditional site-wide button with centralized settings
* Show/hide rules based on page types
* Content exclusion system for specific pages
* Perfect for sites that want consistent behavior everywhere

**Block-Only Mode**
* Use Gutenberg blocks for complete per-page control
* Each block has independent settings (colors, position, behavior)
* No global button - only blocks you explicitly add
* Ideal for complex sites with varied requirements

**Hybrid Mode**
* Global settings provide the default behavior
* Blocks override global settings on pages where they exist
* Best of both worlds - consistency with flexibility
* Recommended for most professional sites

= ðŸ”§ Key Features =

**Scroll Progress Ring**
* Beautiful circular progress indicator around the button
* Shows exact scroll progress (0-100%)
* Fully customizable colors, width, and background
* Automatically disabled for users with motion sensitivity
* Smooth 60fps animations with performance optimization

**Smart Positioning**
* Automatic detection of cookie banners, chat widgets, sticky headers
* Dynamic repositioning to avoid interface conflicts
* Mobile-first design with safe-area insets
* Responsive behavior across all device sizes
* Smooth transitions when obstacles appear/disappear

**Comprehensive Customization**
* Position control (left/right with pixel-perfect offsets)
* Size adjustment (24px to 80px)
* Color customization (background, icon, progress ring)
* Animation timing and easing preferences
* Show/hide conditions and page-specific rules

= ðŸ“± Mobile & Device Support =

**Mobile Optimization**
* iPhone safe-area support (notches, Dynamic Island)
* Android safe-area support (punch-holes, gesture bars)
* Touch-optimized button sizing and positioning
* Responsive design that adapts to orientation changes

**Cross-Browser Compatibility**
* Modern browsers with ES6+ support
